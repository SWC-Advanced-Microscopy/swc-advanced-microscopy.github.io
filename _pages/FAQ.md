## Getting started
1. Attend the **induction** and **laser safety training**. This take place on the **first Tuesday of each month at 09:45**. Just turn up at the Facility no need to book. **We start promptly** and if you are late you have to wait until the next session. 
2. Start an account on the [PPMS Microscope Booking System](https://ppms.eu/ucl-swc/login/?pf=2). Use your SWC (not UCL) login details. If you do not have an SWC account, see SWC IT. The user name **must** by prefixed with `ad\` on the login page. e.g. like this: `ad\tomo`.
3. Please discuss your imaging needs with us before starting the relevant experiments. This can avoid wasted time. 


### Where is the Imaging Facility?
The facility is located in the SWC on Level B2, immediately to the left as you come out of the lifts.


## Do you take samples from external users?
The AMF primarily caters for scientists within the SWC. 
Since we also conduct a lot of internal technique development, we do not have the bandwidth to take on significant numbers of external samples.
However:
1. We can generate small quantities of pilot data.
2. We can assist with technology transfer: helping external groups to build our tools.  
3. We are very open to collaborations with external groups or facilities. 



## Where do I store my data?
We strongly recommend data are stored on one of the managed servers managed by the SWC Scientific Computing team. 
Data on these are backed up to tape and the hardware is well monitored, so this are the safest place to keep your data. 
We also strongly suggest you adhere to the following guidelines:

* Store data in your group's shared directory rather than in your own personal user folder. Data kept in your user folder are only visible to you. 
* Include your initials in the file names of your images, acquisitions (e.g. brainsaw acquisitions), or the lowest level folder that holds the images. This helps trace who produced what. 
* Store images in a sensible directory structure. e.g. `./margrie/projects/MVF_2023_ThreePhotonValidation/BrainSaw`
* Data on the server are backed up to tape. Renaming the folder housing the data or moving the data to a new location **will spawn a new backup**. Please, therefore, try to settle on a suitable folder structure in advance in order to minimize the creation of redundant backups by subsequently moving data around. Avoid routinely placing data in "temporary" locations on the server before moving it on to a final location.
