In common with other microscopy facilities, the AMF follows the [Royal Microscopy Society publication guidelines](https://www.rms.org.uk/community/networks-affiliates/bioimaginguk-network/resources/imaging-facility-publication-guidelines.html). This means that:

1. Publications must acknowledge the AMF (and named staff if appropriate) when a study uses equipment managed by the Facility.
2. In cases where an AMF staff member has contributed significantly and/or provided non-routine services, they are to be added as co-authors. 

Furthermore, we strongly encourage authors to let us proofread your methods section. Imaging methods are [often very poorly reported (eLife)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55133) in publications. Work coming from the SWC should continue to buck this trend. 


## Standard acknowledgement
Examples of standard acknowledgement text:
*  â€˜_The authors would like to thank the SWC Advanced Microscopy Facility for their assistance with confocal imaging._'
*  '_The authors thank John Smith and the SWC Advanced Microscopy Facility for assistance with light microscopy and protocol development._'

## Co-authorship
If Facility scientists should be listed as co-authors if they contributed intellectually or contributed non-routine services or techniques.
Routine work includes things like user training, microscope maintenance, standard histology, and simple raw data acquisition. Examples of non-routine work include:

* Extensive data analysis; in particular generating figures that appear in your publication or building analysis tools to generate those figures. 
* Significant development or optimisation of protocols used in your study. e.g. Validating a new antibody does not count but spending a few weeks developing and documenting a bespoke clearing, labelling, and imaging pipeline does count.
* Building and validating a significant modification to your in vivo imaging pipeline. e.g. Adding a new filter to your rig does not count but helping you construct and validate temporal focusing over 6 months does count.   
* Building significant new equipment. e.g. 3D printing a new sample holder does not count but helping you build a rig for optically tracking mouse toe movements does count.


## Facility URL
If you wish to add a web link, you may use [swcmicroscopy.com](swcmicroscopy.com) for the Facility itself; this will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. If you need to link to a specific sub-page, contact us first to confirm it is not likely to be changed or removed in the near future. Avoid linking to [our GitHub wiki](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/swc-advanced-microscopy.github.io/wiki), as that content is more labile. You may safely link directly to [a relevant AMF GitHub repo](https://github.com/orgs/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/repositories). 

## Citing BrainSaw
The serial section equipment in the facility are not associated with a methods paper. You can cite using DOIs and link for the software repositories:

* **BakingTray acquisition software**: [GitHub link](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/BakingTray), [DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/96208671)
* **StitchIt image assembly**: [GitHub link](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/StitchIt), [DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/57851444)

A reasonable way to cite the equipment in your methods section would be:

"_We imaged the brains using serial section ([Mayer 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02024.x)) two-photon ([Ragan 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297424/)) microscopy. Our microscope was controlled by ScanImage Basic (MBF Bioscience) using BakingTray, a custom software wrapper for setting up the imaging parameters ([DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/96208671)). Images were assembled using StitchIt ([DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/57851444))._"

Then acknowledge as appropriate.
