In common with other microscopy facilities, the AMF follows the [Royal Microscopy Society publication guidelines](https://www.rms.org.uk/community/networks-affiliates/bioimaginguk-network/resources/imaging-facility-publication-guidelines.html). This means that:

1. Publications must acknowledge the AMF (and named staff if appropriate) when a study uses equipment managed by the Facility.
2. In cases where an AMF staff member has contributed significantly and/or provided non-routine services, they are to be added as co-authors. 


## Standard acknowledgement
Examples of standard acknowledgement text:
*  â€˜_The authors would like to thank the SWC Advanced Microscopy Facility for their assistance with confocal imaging_"
*  '_The authors would like to help John Smith for his assistance with light microscopy and protocol development_'



If scientists from Light Microscopy STP contributed more than just routine techniques, they should be co-authors of papers that use data.

          a) Development or adaptation of protocols to suit samples or materials, (re)designing experiments, extensive data analysis and interpretation are not routine and constitute contributions meriting co-authorship.

          b) Simple acquisitions of raw data or routine sample preparations alone normally would not merit co-authorship but should still be acknowledged.



## Citing BrainSaw
The serial section equipment in the facility are not associated with a methods paper. You can cite using DOIs and link for the software repositories:

* **BakingTray acquisition software**: [GitHub link](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/BakingTray), [DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/96208671)
* **StitchIt image assembly**: [GitHub link](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/StitchIt), [DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/57851444)

A reasonable way to cite the equipment in your methods section would be:

"_We imaged the brains using serial section ([Mayer 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02024.x)) two-photon ([Ragan 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297424/)) microscopy. Our microscope was controlled by ScanImage Basic (MBF Bioscience) using BakingTray, a custom software wrapper for setting up the imaging parameters ([DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/96208671)). Images were assembled using StitchIt ([DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/57851444))._"

Then acknowlege as appropriate.
